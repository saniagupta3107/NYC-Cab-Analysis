NYC Cab Service Analysis & Fleet Optimization
This project uses unsupervised machine learning and data analysis to identify spatial and temporal patterns in New York City cab ride data. The goal is to create a data-driven strategy to optimize taxi fleet deployment, reduce passenger wait times, and increase driver efficiency.

The entire analysis is presented as a fully interactive web application built with Streamlit.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive Hotspot Map: Uses K-Means clustering to identify primary pickup hotspots across NYC.

Advanced Density Analysis: A detailed drill-down into the busiest hotspot using the HDBSCAN algorithm to find the most concentrated pickup areas.

Business & Customer Insights: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key business metrics, including:

Distribution of taxi fares.

Typical passenger counts per trip.

Hourly trends in average fare prices.

Interactive Web Application: The entire project is deployed as a user-friendly web app with interactive controls.
