# üöï NYC Cab Service Analysis & Fleet Optimization

This project uses unsupervised machine learning and data analysis to identify spatial and temporal patterns in New York City cab ride data. The goal is to create a data-driven strategy to optimize taxi fleet deployment, reduce passenger wait times, and increase driver efficiency.

The entire analysis is presented as a fully interactive web application built with Streamlit.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Hotspot Map:** Uses K-Means clustering to identify 8 primary pickup hotspots across NYC.
* **Advanced Density Analysis:** A detailed drill-down into the busiest hotspot using the HDBSCAN algorithm to find the most concentrated pickup areas.
* **Business & Customer Insights:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key business metrics, including:
    * Distribution of taxi fares.
    * Typical passenger counts per trip.
    * Hourly trends in average fare prices.
* **Interactive Web Application:** The entire project is deployed as a user-friendly web app with interactive controls.
